This is a tiny app that you can drag into your Mac's
Dock as a quick way to start iTunes playing the WFMU 128Kbps
Internet audio stream (http://wfmu.org/wfmu.pls).

You must first have had iTunes launch the stream once, so it's in
iTunes's _Music_ collection.

See WFMU's web site, http://www.wfmu.org, for information about why
you might or might not want to do that.
